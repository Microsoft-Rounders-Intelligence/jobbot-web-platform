# This workflow will build and push a node.js application to an Azure Web App when a commit is pushed to your default branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your GitHub repository named AZURE_CREDENTIALS.
#
#    To get the credentials, run the following command in the Azure CLI.
#    Replace `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` and `<RESOURCE_GROUP>` with your actual values.
#
#    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions-deploy" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP> --sdk-auth
#
#    This command will output a JSON object. Copy the entire JSON object.
#
# 2. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
#    Create a new repository secret named AZURE_CREDENTIALS and paste the JSON object as the value.
#
# 3. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME environment variable below.
